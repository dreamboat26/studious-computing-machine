# Snake AI Game

## Overview

This project implements a Snake AI game where an AI-controlled snake competes against a user-controlled snake. The goal is to grow the snake by consuming food while avoiding collisions with walls and itself. 

## Features

- **AI-controlled Snake**: The AI uses a basic algorithm to navigate the game environment and eat food.
- **User-controlled Snake**: Players can control their snake using keyboard inputs.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: The game speeds up as the snakes grow longer, increasing the challenge.
- **Simple Graphics**: Basic 2D graphics for easy visibility and interaction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies

 ## Controls

 1.  User Snake:
 2.  Arrow keys: Move the snake
 3.  AI Snake: Controlled by the AI algorithm

## Game Logic

1. The game board is a grid where snakes move in the four cardinal directions.
2. When a snake eats food, it grows longer.
3. The game ends if a snake collides with the wall or itself.

## AI Algorithm

The AI uses a basic pathfinding algorithm to navigate towards the food while avoiding collisions. It calculates the best direction to move based on its current position and the position of the food.
